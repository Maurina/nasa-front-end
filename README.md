## Project setup
```
yarn install

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files

yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### 1. Effectively use conditional logic, JavaScript array methods, and front-end framework elements to render large lists on the web client.
[GraphQL list](https://github.com/Maurina/nasa-front-end/blob/master/src/components/Home.vue)
[REST list](https://github.com/Maurina/nasa-front-end/blob/master/src/components/Rest.vue)

### 2. Work with the proper tools (e.g. VueJS, React) to create and manage the front-end portion of your project within a real development toolset.
[Vue is used for this project](https://github.com/Maurina/nasa-front-end/tree/master/src)

### 3. Work with NPM and NodeJS to create and manage the back-end portion of your project.
